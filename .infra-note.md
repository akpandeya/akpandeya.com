# Infrastructure Configuration

## Caddy Configuration

Caddy web server configuration is managed in the **exterminator-infra** repository:

🔗 https://github.com/akpandeya/exterminator-infra

This repository (`akpandeya.com`) only deploys website files to `/var/www/akpandeya.com/`

## Modifying Web Server Configuration

To modify Caddy configuration for akpandeya.com:

1. Go to the exterminator-infra repository
2. Edit `caddy/Caddyfile`
3. Modify the `akpandeya.com` block
4. Commit and push
5. GitHub Actions will auto-deploy the new configuration

## Why the Separation?

**Before:** Infrastructure configuration was scattered across multiple repositories, causing deployment conflicts.

**Now:** Infrastructure (Caddy, SSL, server config) is centralized in one repository, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.

This ensures:
- Single source of truth for server configuration
- No deployment conflicts between projects
- Clear separation: infrastructure vs application code
- Easy to add new sites without touching application repos
