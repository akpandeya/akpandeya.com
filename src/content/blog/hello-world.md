Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet.

This is where I'll occasionally write about software engineering, optimization problems, and lessons learned along the way.

## What to Expect

I'm a software engineer who spent years in scientific research before transitioning to industry. That background shapes how I think about problems: I value rigor, empirical testing, and elegant solutions.

Topics I might cover:

- Backend architecture and Python patterns
- Optimization algorithms and constraint solving
- DevOps and infrastructure as code
- Lessons from building systems at scale
- Bridging academic research and practical engineering

## Why Write?

Writing helps me clarify my thinking. If some of these posts prove useful to others, that's a bonus.

Thanks for stopping by.
